# The Ex-Text
This is a Google App Engine/Twilio web-app that asks the user for a name and a phone number, and then sends the person a text
`Hey (name) you probably already deleted my number, but I just wanted to let you know that I still hate you.`

If they resond, `responses.py` sends of the responses from `responses.txt`.

You need to set up a Twilio account, app, and phone number for this. It's fun!
