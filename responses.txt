Please just leave me alone.
I don't care what you say anymore. 
You fucked over the wrong person.
This isn't over and you know it.
Don't make me do something stupid. I'm serious.
We could have been beautiful, but you had to shit all over it.
I'm still hurt, I don't know why. How could you do this to me?
I've blocked your number. Don't even try calling me again.
Your breath stank the whole time.
Having sex with you was literally hell.
Please don't talk to me or my friends again
My mom hates you. I told her everything.
If you keep this up, i'll tell your mom everything.
You had no right to do what you did.
Why can't I get over you? God, I hate it! You're so shitty!
I'm done with the crying and bitching to my friends. Just want you to go away.
Just admit you never loved me.
You're gay. Just admit it and quit breaking poeple's hearts. UGH!!
If I ever see you again, just act like you didn't ruin my life please and go away.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! UGH. YOU ALWAYS SAY THIS SHITT!!
